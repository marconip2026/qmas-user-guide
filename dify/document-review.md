### 6. Follow the review

- Flow A and B: the job shows **Being Processed** while the lab reviews. The lab concludes each document as **Approve**, **Reject** or **Waiting for Additional Information**.
- Flow C: when the supplier has uploaded, open the job, click **View detail**, and conclude each document yourself with **Approve**, **Reject**, **N/A** or **Waiting for additional information**. Click **Confirm**.
- If a document is rejected or more information is needed, read the comment and upload a corrected file.
- When all documents are approved, complete the job.

## Tips

- Flows B and C need a connected supplier. Invite the supplier first from Supplier / Factory Management → Invite Supplier.
- Save a TCF document-type list as a template so you can reuse it in the next job.
